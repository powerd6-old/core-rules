  The Game Master is the narrator, puppeteer, and ruler of the world that the characters explore.

  Describing the world, controlling characters, creating the story, and providing mystery, challenge and fun to the other players are the main tasks.

  They also serve as the final voice when it comes to rules arbitration.
  In the case there are disagreements or multiple interpretations, then the game master is the one that decides.
