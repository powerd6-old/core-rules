title: Required materials
body: |-
  To play successfully, some materials are required for the players:

  - This book;
  - Note-taking material, like pen and paper;
  - At least one six-sided die, usually referred to as a d6;

  All of these items can be substituted by virtual alternatives, but for the sake of consistency
  the wording in the rules will reference the physical objects rather than their virtual counterparts.
